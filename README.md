Repository for computer graphics class.

Plans for the assignment: 

Star Fox 64-esque(changed from the idea of making a Space Invaders-like game) game, where you fly a spaceship 
across a map and fight an assortment of enemy spaceships.
I will use as basis the cube sample we practiced on during class.
